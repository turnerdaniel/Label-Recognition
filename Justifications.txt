Salt & Pepper noise not common on digital images so didn't use median filter

Originally used CLAHE but that introduced more noise and increased size of
letters; leading to joining

Laplacian/unsharp mask sharpening produce very similar results.
Laplacian more noisy on some tests but neither of them have clear
advantages.


Region Properties
------------------------------------
Attempted to use compactness and circulairty but would remove important
details and thresholds had to be reduced to the point of useless-ness.

Stroke Width Transform
------------------------------------
Attempted to use minimun variaton to eliminate holes in the middle of
letters to permit accurate SWT. However, meant that SWT wasn't recorded
correctly due to NaN and 0 being present in std(SWT)/mean(SWT)

The CCEMSER was needed to ensure that letters weren't filled & therefore
SWT would be more accurate/less false positives

Rule-Based Candidate Text Grouping
------------------------------------
Tried to use closing to combine the text into lines. However, it
resulted in being difficult to respond to the different font sizes.
Making it hard to capture the entire date without
over-expanding/under-expanding

Text usually has a difference lower than half the height. Else is
removed since it is not text or not related due to high variation. 
    
Attempted to use IQR() and std() to help calculate text height but
that ended up removing legitimate candidates/not have any affect due 
to the size of their margin of error.
