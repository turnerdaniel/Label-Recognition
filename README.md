# Label Recognition

Label Recognition provides a MATLAB application that is capable of recognising expiry dates within a natural image and displaying them back to the user.

The application utillises a fully-documented class, `LabelRecogniser`, that implements the expiry date detection and recognition algorithm that is provided with this repository. 

## Prerequisites

This project requires MATLAB, a proprietary langauage developed by MathWorks, for execution. 

**It is recommended to use the latest stable release of MATLAB**. The performance of releases preceding MATLAB 2018a is not guranteed.

*Please check with your institution/organisation to see if you are offered a free MATLAB license. Otherwise, see the [licensing options](https://www.mathworks.com/pricing-licensing.html) available.*

## Installation
### Application

1. Navigate to [latest release](https://github.com/turnerdaniel/Label-Recognition/releases/latest) of this repository.

2. Download the `Label Recognition.mlappinstall` file.

3. Open the file and follow the installation instructions until it completes.

### Class

1. Extract the zip file or clone the repository into a desired directory.

2. Add the parent directory (Label-Recognition) to the path by:
    * Going to Home &rarr; Environment &rarr; Set Path, or
    * Running `addpath [directory]` in the Command Window, or 
    * Having the parent directory selected as the Current Folder.

3. Use in your own MATLAB code.

*Note: Seperating the `LabelRecogniser.m` file into its own directory may improve path performance.*

## Usage
### Application

*Ensure that the current folder does not contain `LabelRecognition.m` or `LabelRecogniser.m` files since they could shadow the app entry point.* 

1. Go to Apps Tab &rarr; My Apps &rarr; Label Recognition.

2. Use the GUI window to perform actions such as:

    - Selecting an image
    - Performing date recognition
    - Configuring detection parameters
    - Viewing recognised dates
    - Outputting dates to a file

*Auto-Reflow* is used to ensure that the app optimally scales to the desired screen size.

### Class

1. Initialise a `LabelRecogniser` object with an image. This can be either a filepath or an image matrix.

    ```MATLAB
    lr = LabelRecogniser('samples/good1.jpeg');
    ```

2. Call `recogniseDates()` on the `LabelRecogniser` object to identify expiry dates 
    
    ```MATLAB
    dates = lr.recogniseDates()

    dates = 
        "25 MAR"
    ```

    Alternatively, candidate bounding boxes may be returned too. 
    ```MATLAB
    [dates, bboxes] = lr.recogniseDates()

    dates = 
        "25 MAR"

    bboxes = 
        252.8333    1.0000  106.3333   48.0000
        374.1667  241.5000  165.0000   56.0000
        ...       ...       ...        ...
    ```
    
Further help is provided by using the Command Window to execute:

```MATLAB
doc LabelRecogniser
```

## Demonstration

Above shows the MATLAB app successfully identifying the expiry date from an image.

Above shows the MATLAB app automatically reflowing content to fit onto a smaller screen.

![GUI Error Reporting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35703802/73096392-957dd380-3edc-11ea-9cf9-f6379f626c0b.png "GUI Error Reporting")

Above shows clear error messages being produced which suggest possible fixes when something goes wrong.

Alternatively, a demonstration of the `LabelRecogniser` class functionality is provided by the `main.m` script. Execute it in the Command Window using:

```MATLAB
main
```

## Standalone Executable

A standalone executable version of this project was planned to allow non-MATLAB users to utilise the system. However, due to unforseen complications relating to C/C++ code generation, this is no longer being developed.

This is due to several functions being used such as `wiener2`, `detectMSERFeatures`, `imresize`, `imcrop`, `ocr`, etc. all having several quirks that will require a major rework of the `LabelRecogniser` class due to incompatabilities with MATLAB Compiler.

More details on the exact changes required can be found [here](https://mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/code-generation-support-usage-notes-and-limitations-for-functions-classes-and-system-objects.html).
